/*

Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk is like a helper that:

sends the request, and automatically dispatches actions like:

yourThunkName/pending

yourThunkName/fulfilled ‚úÖ

yourThunkName/rejected ‚ùå

The fulfilled action it dispatches has this shape:

{
  type: 'fetchAnnouncements/fulfilled',
  payload: <data from server>
}
  üß© Piece	ü§ì Role
createAsyncThunk	Sends the request and dispatches pending, fulfilled, or rejected.
extraReducers	Handles those dispatched actions (especially fulfilled).

In short , asyncThunks will return the data from te serer as actions to the extra reducers
